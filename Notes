Trip

        going to return nil if trip in progress

    returns false if end time nil
    going to return nil if trip in progress

    returns time since trip in hours
    returns nil if end_time end time is nil
        going to return nil if trip in progress

Driver

    returns true if driver available
    returns false if driver unavailable

- method not in use
- drivers_completed_trips
    returns list of completed trips (calls trip_completed?)

WHAT TO DO

RETURN...
AVAILABLE_DRIVERS = @drivers.select {|driver| driver.available? }
    ---> list of available drivers


ANT = AVAILABLE_DRIVERS.select {|driver| !driver.on_trip_now? }
    ---> PEOPLE ABOVE ARE AVAILABLE AND NOT ON A TRIP


SELECTED_DRIVER = ANT.find {|driver| driver.trips.empty? }

return SELECTED_DRIVER if SELECTED_DRIVER != nil

ANY REMAINING PEOPLE IN ANT WILL HAVE WORKED BEFORE

SELECTED_DRIVER = ANT.max_by { |driver|
  driver.drivers_most_recent_trip.time_since_trip }

return SELECTED_DRIVER



WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
Modify TripDispatcher#request_trip to use the following rules to select a Driver:

The Driver must have a status of AVAILABLE
The Driver must not have any in-progress trips (end time of nil)
From the Drivers that remain, select the one whose most recent trip ended the longest time ago
