Exercise: Look at this requirement in Wave 1: "For a given driver, calculate their total revenue for all trips. Each driver gets 80% of the trip cost after a fee of $1.65 is subtracted." Spend some time writing pseudocode for this.


pseudocode: Total Revenue for Driver

Input: none
Output: Total revenue (float)
Where does it live? Driver#total_revenue

def total_revenue
  fee = 1.65
  driver_takehome = 0.8

  subtotal = 0
  @trips.each do |trip|
    #Question: what id the cost is less than the fee
    subtotal += trip.cost - fee
  end

  total = subtotal * driver_takehome
  return total
end
